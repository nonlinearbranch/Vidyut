#  Vidyut: Electricity Theft Detection System

**Vidyut** is an advanced multi layered anomaly detection system designed to detect electricity theft, visualize grid health, and identify risky consumers using a multi-layer machine learning pipeline. This system empowers utility companies to minimize revenue loss and ensure grid stability.

##  Key Features

###  Multi-Layer Anomaly Detection
The core engine (`electrical_bomb.py`) uses a weighted ensemble of detection techniques:
1.  **Behavioral Analysis (ML):** Isolation Forest model to detect unusual consumption patterns.
2.  **Statistical Outliers:** Z-Score analysis for extreme deviation from personal history.
3.  **Transformer Loss:** Discrepancy between transformer input and total consumer load.
4.  **Peer Comparison:** Deviations from the average consumption of connected peers.
5.  **Voltage & Seasonal:** Alerts on voltage irregularities and seasonal consumption drops.

###  Risk Classification
The system categorizes consumers into risk levels for actionable insights:
-   **CRITICAL (Red):** Immediate theft likely. Top priority for inspection.
-   **HIGH (Orange):** strong indicators of theft (Top 20% risk).
-   **MILD (Yellow):** Suspicious behavior detected but requires monitoring.
-   **NORMAL (Green):** Safe patterns.

*Note: The "Anomalies" dashboard focuses strictly on **Critical** and **High** risk cases.*

###  Interactive Dashboard
-   **Grid Health Overview:** Real-time metrics on system status and estimated revenue loss.
-   **Transformer Analytics:** Interactive Pie & Bar charts showing risk distribution per transformer.
-   **Geospatial Map:** Google Maps integration that pins **High (Orange)** and **Critical (Red)** risk locations for field teams.
-   **Detailed Reporting:**
    -   **Detected Anomalies:** Actionable list of high-risk consumers with "Select Status" workflow.
    -   **Other Entries:** Secondary view for "Mild" and "Normal" consumers.

###  Export & Management
-   **PDF Export:** Generate professional audit reports (`electricity_theft_report.pdf`).
-   **Inspection Tracking:** Track status (Initiated, In Process, Completed) directly from the dashboard.

##  Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v16+)
-   Python (v3.8+)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nonlinearbranch/Vidyut.git
cd Vidyut
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder and set up the Python environment.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the Backend Server:**
```bash
# Run from the 'backend' directory
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
*The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`*

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the **frontend** folder, and install dependencies.

```bash
# Return to root if in backend, then enter frontend
cd ../frontend 

npm install
```

**Run the Frontend Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
*The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`*

##  Usage Guide

1.  **Launch:** Open the web app at `http://localhost:5173`.
2.  **Upload Data:** Drag & drop your dataset (single merged CSV or the 5 standard separate files). [Sample](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samayrajat/final-electricity-skewed)
3.  **Analyze:** Watch the pipeline process data in real-time.
4.  **Investigate:**
    -   Check the **Global Map** for Red/Orange pins.
    -   Review the **Anomalies Table** and set inspection status.
    -   Click the **Pie Chart Icon** on the "Est. Loss" card to analyze specific transformers.
5.  **Report:** Download the PDF report for offline audits.
